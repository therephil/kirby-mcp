# Integration Test Guidelines

## Mission

Validate behavior that depends on Kirby runtime, CLI execution, or the fixture site.

## System

- Fixture Kirby site lives in `tests/cms/` (generated test data).
- `tests/cms/` must not be committed/changed in PRs; regenerate it locally with `composer cms:starterkit` (CI does this automatically).
- Use `cmsPath()` from `tests/Pest.php` to reference it.
- Integration tests may invoke `bin/kirby-mcp` / Kirby CLI via the same runner used in production code.

## Workflows

- Prefer asserting observable contracts: exit codes, returned arrays/JSON, created command files, rendered output.
- Run just integration tests: `vendor/bin/pest tests/Integration`.
- Coverage: run `composer cms:starterkit` then `herd coverage ./vendor/bin/pest --coverage` (see `TESTING.md`).
- When adding runtime commands/tools, add integration tests for both the CLI command and the MCP tool wrapper.
- For HTTP transport changes, add focused integration coverage for default stdio not entering HTTP mode, `/mcp` POST/GET/DELETE/OPTIONS behavior, `MCP-Session-Id` reuse, auth/origin failures, remote-token public-route guards, insufficient scopes, and unchanged confirm gates for write/eval/query tools.

## Guardrails

- Keep `tests/cms/` stable; avoid editing it unless the test explicitly requires it.
- Avoid network calls; tests should pass offline.
- Global `beforeEach` clears Kirby MCP static caches; don’t rely on cached state across tests.
