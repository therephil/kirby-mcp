## [Unreleased]

## [1.6.0] - 2026-05-18

- Added an opt-in `kirby-mcp http` listener for a Streamable HTTP MCP endpoint at `/mcp`; stdio remains the default transport.
- Added file-backed HTTP MCP sessions, GET SSE delivery, POST JSON-RPC handling, DELETE session cleanup, and authenticated CORS preflight support.
- Added mandatory Bearer auth for HTTP, shared-token loopback mode, query-string credential rejection, Origin validation, OAuth protected-resource metadata wiring, and per-operation scope enforcement.
- Documented HTTP configuration, security defaults, validation commands, and the current fail-closed OAuth listener limitation.
- Renamed the internal HTTP request handler from `HttpMcpTracer` to `HttpMcpHandler`.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-26

- Updated MCP PHP SDK dependency to `mcp/sdk` v0.5.0.
- Added MCP spec-level titles to tools and prompts, and exposed prompt titles through prompt resources.
- Reworked confirmation elicitation to use titled enum choices (`execute` / `preview`) while keeping legacy boolean confirmations working.
- Refreshed project dependencies, including Kirby CMS 5.4.0, Symfony 7.4 components, `symfony/finder`, and Prettier 3.8.3.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-24

- Updated MCP PHP SDK dependency to `mcp/sdk` v0.4.0.
- Added MCP resource update notifications for subscribed resources after successful content writes (`kirby_update_page_content`, `kirby_update_site_content`, `kirby_update_file_content`, `kirby_update_user_content`).
- Notifications use `notifications/resources/updated` and currently include only the changed resource `uri` (clients should re-read the resource for fresh content).
- Subscription tracking is session-scoped and event-based (emitted after successful write tools; out-of-band file/panel edits are not detected).
- Added optional client-side MCP elicitation confirmation for confirm-gated runtime tools (`kirby_update_page_content`, `kirby_update_site_content`, `kirby_update_file_content`, `kirby_update_user_content`, `kirby_eval`, `kirby_query_dot`) while keeping explicit `confirm=true` behavior and dry-run fallback.
- Kept backward compatibility for update-tool `data` payloads by accepting both JSON objects and JSON-encoded object strings in tool schemas and runtime parsing.
